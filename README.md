The code was implemented in spanish but it is easy 
to understand. The algorithm used for solving the 
8-puzzle is the A* (A star) algorithm, and it uses 
the manhattan metric.

#-----------------------------------------------#

Prerequisites:
Any version of python must be installed.

#-----------------------------------------------#

Running:

   python Solving_the_8_puzzle.py
   
   The implementation will ask you for building 
   a random instance of the 8-puzzle or if you 
   want to type a particular one.
   
   For example, let's assume you want to solve 
   an instaces with the following initial state:
   
                * - * - * - *
                | 8 | 6 | 7 |
                * - * - * - *
                | 2 | 5 | 4 |
                * - * - * - *
                | 3 |   | 1 |
                * - * - * - *
                
 Thus, you will need to type : 8672543 1
